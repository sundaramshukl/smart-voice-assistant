# Smart Voice Assistant

This project is a smart voice assistant developed using Python. It performs basic tasks such as fetching weather updates, playing music, and answering general questions through voice commands. The assistant uses speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to understand what the user is saying and responds using text-to-speech.

## Features

- Takes voice input through a microphone
- Responds with voice using text-to-speech
- Fetches weather updates from an API
- Plays local music files when asked
- Answers general queries using NLP

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- Python 3
- speechrecognition
- pyttsx3
- pyaudio
- requests
- nltk or spacy (for NLP)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/sundaramshukl/smart-voice-assistant.git cd smart-voice-assistant

2. Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the assistant:
python main.py

Once the program starts, you can speak commands like:
- "What is the weather in Varanasi?"
- "Play music"
- "Who is the Prime Minister of India?"

The assistant will listen to your voice and respond accordingly.
